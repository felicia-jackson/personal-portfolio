    <h3 class="title">About Me</h3>
    <p>Welcome!</p>

    <p>
    My background is in education.  So as a lifelong learner, I decided it was time to learn a new skill.  I knew even before I began this course, acquiring this new skill was not going to be easy.  As an undergraduate, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in International Business and Spanish.  Later, I decided to pursue a masters degree in Curriculum and Instruction. After 10+ years in education, it made sense to bring on a new challenge.  Having a Spanish as a second language background helped me prepare to learn another "foreign language"- computer programming.

    <p>
    This journey of continuing education through Batch Academy has taken me out of my comfort zone and pushed me past my limits.  This has been a marathon of learning the essentials of coding.  Through my experience, I have gone from having the bare minimum HTML knowledge (from over ten years ago) to designing a website using CSS, responsive design, JQuery, and JavaScript.
